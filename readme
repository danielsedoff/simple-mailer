simple-mailer

This PHP mailer takes a comma-separated email list from subscribers.txt,
another one from unsubscribers.txt, and sends a message stored in 
mailer-message.html, to everyone in subscribers.txt. The mailer-message.html
contains a '@RECEPIENT@' line which is replaced with the corresponding
email every time it sends the mail to someone.

Keep in mind that in order to unsubscribe people, you need to put this 
to the /unsubscribe/ directory or otherwise change this directory in the
PHP file and in the templates.

This software depends on the PHP mail() function.
